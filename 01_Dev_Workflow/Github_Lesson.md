## Objectives
- Manage change in a project.
- Collaborate over time and space.
- Fork a repository.
- Clone a repository
- Synchronize repositories locally.
- Synchronize repositories remotely.


## Prerequisites
- Complete [Git Basics](Git_Lesson.md)

## Overview 

Continuing in our project, [Git Basics](Git_Lesson.md) we are going to use Github to manage a project.

Each person that is working in project will be working on their own computer. They will have a local copy of the project and will be using Git to manage change.
The challenge is to be able to manage change across all the local copies of a project distributed over multiple computers!

In order to do this we will create a repository on github that will be the definitive version of the project. This "repo" will live in a github account owned by the company or project team. This is the *project owner's repo*.

And each person/developer that would like to contribute their changes to the project will also have a github account. As we'll see we **fork** or copy the repo from the project owner's github account into our github account.

## Contributing to a Project on Github

When we want to make and contribut changes to a project on Github we will:

1. __Fork__ a repo into our Github account from the project's original repo. 
2. __Clone__ that forked repo onto our development/local machine.
3. Make and Commit changes on our local machine.
4. Push changes to our __Fork__ in our Github account.
5. From our __Fork__ we will create a __Pull Request__ that will ask the owner of the repo we forked from to add our changes to the original repository.



## Forking a Repository.

Given a project repository in an account owned by the project team we will create create a copy or **fork the repo**.

## We Do

Let's walk through [Github's fork a repo page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

### Pull Requests

When we want to make changes we will submit a __Pull Request__

Let's walk through [Github's info on submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

## You Do and Homework

I would like you to:

1. __Fork__ and __Clone__ this repo to your local machine. [Git Lab Color Master](https://github.com/tdyer/wdi_1_git_lab_colormaster).
2. Complete the instructions in the README file, working on your local machine.
3. Push your changes to your __Fork__ in your Github account.
4. Submit a __Pull Request__ to me, the owner of the __Orignal__ Color Master Repo. Asking me to incorporate the work you've done!
5. Sleep ;-)
