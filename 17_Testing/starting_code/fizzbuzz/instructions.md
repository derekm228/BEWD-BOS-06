FizzBuzz:
Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Directions:
Look at the test in the fizzbuzz_test.rb
Run the test and see it fail
Write a function called divisible_by_3 in fizzbuzz.rb to make the test pass
Write a test for a (not yet created) function divisible_by 5
Run the test and see it fail
Write the code to make that pass
Write a test for fizzbuzz
Run the test and see it fail
Write the code to make that pass
