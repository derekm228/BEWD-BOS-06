Back-End Web Development
--------

##MIDTERM OPTION 1
##REQUIREMENTS

Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

-  Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).
- Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
- Must be object oriented. You must instantiate modeled classes. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.
- Push code on Github.


API Ideas:

* Twitter search api
* reddit or digg news api
* [other cool apis](http://expressivesyntax.tumblr.com/post/129765227243/top-6-awesomely-nerdy-data-sets-apis)

- Must be object oriented. Game objects must have coresponding classes
- Takes input from the user to control objects on the screen.
- Must have interaction between at least two of the game objects (e.g. bouncing, destroying, collecting, creating)
- Push code on Github.
